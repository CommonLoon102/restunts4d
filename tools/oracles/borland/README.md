# Archived Borland regression oracles

These executable files use the original game disassembly and Borland-built dump
wrappers as independent regression references. They must not be rebuilt with
Watcom or replaced while fixing the C port.

Current CI uses both archived oracles to generate missing or invalid cached
outputs. The archived renderer uses incremental redraws and hashes every frame,
including frame 0, with the `PIXLDUMP 2` output format.

| File | Bytes | Purpose |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `repldumo.exe` | 244284 | Per-frame game state (`.BIN`) |
| `pixldumo.exe` | 247895 | MurmurHash3_x86_32 framebuffer samples (`.PDO`) |

`SHA256SUMS` identifies the exact archived bytes. The initial references were
copied from `stunts/` before compiler/linker migration. The physics oracle is
unchanged by the Murmur32 migration.

The renderer oracle was deliberately rebuilt with Borland on 2026-09-13 to
replace MD5 with MurmurHash3_x86_32, seed 0. Its pre-change rebuild matched the
previous archived executable byte for byte. The source fingerprints, tool hashes,
and regression results in [pixldumo-provenance.json](pixldumo-provenance.json)
describe that historical sampled, full-redraw build.

Commit `b900ca1b` on 2026-09-15 replaced it with the current incremental renderer
and updated `SHA256SUMS`. The provenance record identifies this replacement
separately; its earlier build inputs and validation results remain historical.
The C port's legacy memory model uses the incremental Borland oracle's retained
image size of `0x39E6` paragraphs; see [renderer parity](../../../docs/renderer-parity.md).

From the repository root, verify the archives and prepare both Borland
references for local comparisons on Linux:

```sh
(cd tools/oracles/borland && sha256sum --check SHA256SUMS)
cp tools/oracles/borland/repldumo.exe tools/oracles/borland/pixldumo.exe stunts/
```

Build the candidate `repldump` and `pixldump` executables using the
[repository build instructions](../../../readme.md#how-to-build). For local
comparisons against the archived renderer, use `pixelcheck.sh` with `rebuild=false`
after copying the references above. `rebuild=true` builds both renderer tools,
replacing `stunts/pixldumo.exe` with the Watcom source build.
`validate-toolchain.py` also takes `pixldumo.exe` from `--candidate-directory`
(default `stunts/`) while using the archived physics oracle. Source builds leave
the files in this archive unchanged.

Compare `.BIN` against ported `.BNI`, and `.PDO` against ported `.PDD`.
Current renderer dumps start with `PIXLDUMP 2` and CRLF, followed by one row
for every frame from frame 0 through the replay's final frame. Framebuffer rows
contain a decimal frame number, one space, eight lowercase
hexadecimal hash digits (most significant first), and CRLF. Camera and target
options must match on both sides. Headerless full-redraw outputs from earlier
renderer versions, five-frame sampled dumps, and old MD5 files are incompatible
with current incremental comparisons; the shared regression runner rejects and
regenerates those caches.

See the [shared regression runner](../../scripts/dumpsrv/README.md) for running
and merging replay comparisons. CI imports published physics and renderer caches
and uses the corresponding archived Borland oracle when regeneration is needed.
A deliberate oracle change requires provenance and regression review.
